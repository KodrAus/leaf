//! One of the steps during [backpropagation][backprop] is determining the
//! gradient for each weight.
//! In theory this can be achieved very well using [Gradient Descent (GD)][gd].
//! In practice however applying GD when minimizing an objective function
//! for large datasets, quickly becomes computationaly unfeasible.
//!
//! Luckily GD can be approximated by taking a small random subset
//! from the training dataset, commonly refered to as *mini-batch*.
//! We then compute the gradients
//! only for the samples from the mini-batch and average over these gradients,
//! resulting in an estimate of the global gradient.</br>
//! This method is refered to as **Stochastic Gradient Descent**.
